            <p className="about-text">
                This girl is just something else.. You wouldn’t believe what she’s
                done for me and how much I would do for her. Honestly, I can’t
                find an imperfection - she’s beautiful, smart, humble, woke, caring,
                forgiving, a ray of sunshine and the best thing that’s ever
                happened to me. I could keep going on, but I still have a lot to say.
                </p>
            <p className="about-text">
                I don’t know why and  I don’t know how but this one girl apperead
                in my life. It was like god sent me an angel to help me. It’s honestly
                incredible, I don’t know how I got this lucky.
                </p>
            <p className="about-text">
                Alright - enough about me, I’m sure you want to hear more about
                the girl. Why is she so amazing? In general, it’s not that
                noticeacble at first, but when you get to know a person, you really
                notice all the little things they do - always being concerned about
                troubling anyone, but themselves, or putting too much effort into
                the litte things that really shouldn’t matter that much, but they do.
            </p>
            <p className="about-text">
                No matter what happens in this world, I’ll never forget about my
                first girlfriend, my first genuine life partner, my first sunshine and
                my first real love.
